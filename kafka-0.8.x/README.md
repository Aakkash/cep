# Kafka Spout Example


A Simple Kafka Produce/Consumer Example With In-Memory Kafka and Zookeeper Test Fixture Servers - Kafka 0.8.*


## Description

This example updates the code in ../kafka (which worked against 0.7.*) to the latest version at the 
time of this writing.   

Please see comments in the earlier version, here: 
https://github.com/buildlackey/cep/blob/master/kafka/README.md


The previous document basically applies to this version, although some source code level 
statements have been tweaked to conform to the newer API.
